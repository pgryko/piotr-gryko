Loosing your wallet, getting hacked, falling for a scam, sending money to a wrong address - there are many ways to mess up with cryptocurrencies. While the Bitcoin protocol is quite well established (it's been around for 10yrs), the surrounding software (wallets, exchanges and payment systems etc) are all beta software at best, and general a nightmare to use. Here are 10 ways in which you can mess up with crypto currencies, with recommendations on how to avoid them.

1) Gambling what you can't afford to loose

Cryptocurrencies are NOT and investment. There are no laws governing them, or guarantees on issues to honour promises. They are an extremely early technology, with volatile pricing, driven by pure speculation. At best they are speculation and at worst gambling.

2) "Hacked coin-exchange"

Many online coin exchanges start up, accept deposits, run for a while and then get "hacked". I.e. They run off with your money and disappear into the ether. 

The most famous example of this is MTGOX, who ran away with xx Bitcoin

Even more established exchanges, I.e. ones that have been around for more than 2 years, are constantly under attack by hackers.

Tips: Try to use exchanges that have been around for longer, enable two stage authentication and if you have large amounts of crypto currency, keep if offline on a cold wallet

3) Getting hacked yourself

Be careful on what you install on your computer. Be especially careful of what coin wallets you use. Try to use official ones.

Protip: Use a password manager to store unique passwords for each site and service that you use. Websites are supposed to salt and hash all user passwords, (think of it like washing your hands after going to the toilet), but many don't. Special thanks goes to Linkdin for leaking my password in 2016
